My lab machine is a HP T630 Thin Client which I bought on [olx](https://olx.pl) for 40 PLN (~10$).
Makes it perfect for a low consumption home server staying in my bedroom, as it requires only passive cooling.

Under the hood it has two M2 slots for drives, two slots for RAM (now there lies 2x4GB sticks), soundcard, a small cheap speaker which produces a horrible but authentic sound. There is also a place for Wi-Fi chip. All I had to buy additionally was one 128 GB SATA drive (30 PLN) and one 4 GB RAM stick (30 PLN), which was an overkill, but prices on RAM weren't that high back then. The total cost of hardware appears to be 100 PLN (~28$ on 2026-02-13).

Good thing about this mini-pc is that it has quite a few ports:
- Power Connector (DC-in)
- VGA IN/OUT
- Audio Jack
- 2xDisplayPort
- 2xUSB 2.0 on the back, 4x on the front
- PS/2 Mouse and Keyboard Ports
- Ethernet RJ-45
